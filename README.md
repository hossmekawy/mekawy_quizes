## Features in Detail

### Automatic Answer Detection
The text parsing feature includes intelligent answer detection for Operating Systems topics:
- RTOS concepts and characteristics
- Operating system functions and components
- Scheduling algorithms
- Memory management
- Process management
- Real-time systems
- And more...

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-friendly interface
- Adaptive layouts for different screen sizes
- Touch-friendly buttons and interactions

### Data Persistence
- Questions are stored in memory during the session

## Customization

### Adding New Answer Patterns
To improve automatic answer detection, edit the `answer_map` dictionary in `app.py`:

```python
answer_map = {
    'your_keyword_pattern': 'correct_answer_letter',
    # Add more patterns...
}
```
